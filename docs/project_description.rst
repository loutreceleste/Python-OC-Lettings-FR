*********************

This project is part of the ongoing development efforts at OC Lettings, a company operating in the real estate rental sector. Our task is to make improvements that allow the company to evolve in line with market expectations, with the necessary modularity and flexibility required in this industry.

The project focuses on addressing several key areas:

1. **Redesign of modular architecture in the GitHub repository:** We are restructuring the project's GitHub structure by adopting a modular architecture. This will enable better component management and facilitate future enhancements.

2. **Reduction of various technical debts in the project:** We are identifying and resolving accumulated technical complexities within the project. This includes reducing technical debt to ensure a solid and sustainable foundation.

3. **Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline and deployment:** We are setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This automation will enable faster, stable, and reproducible deployments.

4. **Application monitoring and error tracking via Sentry:** We are integrating Sentry to monitor the application in real-time and track errors. This will allow us to quickly identify issues and improve application reliability.

5. **Creation of technical documentation for the application using Read The Docs and Sphinx:** We are drafting comprehensive technical documentation using Read The Docs and Sphinx. Clear and up-to-date documentation will enhance understanding and collaboration within the team.


We believe that by addressing these points, we will succeed in establishing a suitable architecture for the evolution of OC Lettings.
