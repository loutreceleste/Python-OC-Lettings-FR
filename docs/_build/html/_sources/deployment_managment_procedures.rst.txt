Deployment and management procedures for the application.
**********************************************************

The OC Lettings application uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The following is a description of the deployment and management procedures for the application.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before deploying the OC Lettings application, ensure you have the following tools and accounts installed and set up:

- **AWS account:** An account with Amazon Web Services to deploy the application on the cloud.

- **Docker:** A platform to build, run, and manage containers.

- **Python:** A programming language used to develop the application.

- **GitHub account:** A web-based platform for version control and collaboration.

- **Git:** A distributed version control system to manage the source code.

- **AWS CLI:** A command-line tool to interact with AWS services.

- **ECS CLI:** A command-line tool to manage Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters.

- **Sentry account:** An error tracking and monitoring tool to identify and resolve issues in real-time.

Having these prerequisites in place will ensure a smooth deployment process for the OC Lettings application.

Secret Variables
----------------

The OC Lettings application uses secret variables to store sensitive information required for deployment and management. These variables are stored securely in GitHub secrets and AWS Secrets Manager.

The following secret variables are used in the GitHub Actions workflow:

- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:** The AWS access key ID required to authenticate with AWS services.

- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:** The AWS secret access key required to authenticate with AWS services.

- **AWS_REGION:** The AWS region in which the ECS cluster and ECR repository are located.

- **ECR_URL_REPOSITORY:** The URL of the ECR repository where the Docker image is stored.

- **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:** The Docker Hub username required to authenticate with Docker Hub.

- **DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD:** The Docker Hub password required to authenticate with Docker Hub.

These secret variables are referenced in the GitHub Actions workflow using the ${{ secrets.<SECRET_NAME> }} syntax. For example, the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secret is referenced using ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}.

GitHub Actions Integration
--------------------------

The GitHub Actions workflow file is triggered on every push event to any branch. The workflow performs the following tasks:

1. **Checkout code:** The code is checked out from the repository using the actions/checkout@v2 action.

2. **Install Python and dependencies:** The workflow installs Python and the required dependencies using apt and pip.

3. **Run Tests with Coverage:** The workflow runs the unit tests using pytest and generates a coverage report.

4. **Run Linting:** The workflow runs flake8 to ensure that the code adheres to style guidelines.

If the push event is to the master branch, the workflow also performs the following tasks:

1. **Set up AWS credentials:** The workflow sets up AWS credentials using the aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2 action.

2. **Build Docker image to ECR and DockerHub:** The workflow builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the root directory of the repository and tags it with the commit hash.

3. **Push Docker image to ECR:** The workflow pushes the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using the aws command line interface.

4. **Push Docker image to DockerHub and to local:** The workflow pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub and to the local Docker registry using the docker command line interface.

Deployment
----------

The deployment process for the OC Lettings application involves the following steps:

1. **Prepare the environment:** Set up a server with the required specifications and install the necessary software, including Docker and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) CLI.

2. **Pull the Docker image:** Use the docker pull command to pull the latest version of the Docker image from ECR or Docker Hub.

3. **Configure ECS task definition:** Configure the ECS task definition to use the latest version of the Docker image.

4. **Update the ECS service:** Update the ECS service to use the new task definition.

5. **Test the application:** Test the application to ensure that it is functioning correctly.

The deployment process is automated using the GitHub Actions workflow described above. The workflow updates the ECS task definition and service automatically whenever a new Docker image is pushed to ECR.

Monitoring and Error Tracking
------------------------------

The OC Lettings application uses Sentry for monitoring and error tracking. Sentry provides real-time error tracking and alerting, allowing the development team to quickly identify and resolve issues. The team can also use Sentry to view detailed information about errors and their causes, as well as to track trends in error rates over time.
